# Example of a Request and Generation of a TODO Application

## Request
The goal is to create a web application for task management with visualization of workflow stages using the Kanban methodology. The application should allow users to create, edit, and move tasks between stages, assign responsible users, set priorities and deadlines, and visualize progress on a Kanban board. The main Kanban stages are: Backlog (tasks to do), In Progress, Testing, Done. There should be an option to add or remove stages via the admin panel.

Each task should include a title, a description with Markdown support, priority (low, medium, high), deadline, responsible user, tags (e.g., "bug", "feature", "urgent"), and a change history. Additional features: notifications about approaching deadlines (email/in-system), file attachments to tasks, search and filter tasks by tags, priority, and assignees, export tasks to CSV/PDF.
